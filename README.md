# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This is a modern and responsive **Home Page** for a fictional IELTS Institute called **IELTSPro**.  
It is built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, focusing on clean UI, mobile responsiveness, and reusability of components.
